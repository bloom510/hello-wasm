This project builds upon the rust-webpack-template by hooking react into the build pipeline.

* First, [install `wasm-pack`!](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

* `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
  `http://localhost:8080`.

* `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).
